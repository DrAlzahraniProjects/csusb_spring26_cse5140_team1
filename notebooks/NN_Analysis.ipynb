    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Summarize the tuning experiment by visualizing how validation performance varies across trial instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Load `phase2_validation_results.csv` and order trials by `trial_id`.\n",
    "- Plot trial index against `val_r2` to reveal dispersion, trends, or outliers.\n",
    "- Label axes and add a grid for readable comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "This plot is a visual proxy for sensitivity analysis: each point is an estimate of validation R² under a sampled hyperparameter configuration. Wide variance suggests that architecture/optimizer choices materially affect fit quality rather than producing marginal differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "Because each trial corresponds to a distinct MLP configuration, the curve indirectly reflects which hyperparameter regions are stable. It also flags whether performance improvements are sporadic (high variance) or systematic (consistent uplift).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "A line plot with markers appears. Look for abrupt jumps or isolated peaks, which indicate that only a few configurations achieved strong validation performance.\n"

    "## 🧾 Cell 13 — 🧪 Learning dynamics: training loss vs validation RMSE_log for top trials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Inspect how the strongest configurations *arrived* at their performance by comparing within-epoch optimization behavior to validation error trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Reload the tuning results and select the top 3 trials by `val_r2`.\n",
    "- For each selected trial, load its per-epoch `history_csv`.\n",
    "- Plot `train_loss` (SmoothL1) and `val_rmse_log` (dashed) across epochs on the same axes.\n",
    "- Use legends to keep trial identities distinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "Two distinct functionals are plotted: the training objective (SmoothL1 on log residuals) and the validation metric (RMSE in log space). Their joint evolution indicates whether optimization is continuing to reduce training loss while validation error stabilizes or reverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "This diagnostic is particularly informative for dropout/weight-decay regimes: strong regularization often yields slower training loss reduction but smoother validation curves, whereas unstable learning rates manifest as oscillatory validation RMSE_log.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "Expect multiple curves: for each trial, a solid line for training loss and a dashed line for validation RMSE_log. Early-stopped trials will have shorter traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Quality checks\n",
    "If `val_rmse_log` increases while `train_loss` decreases monotonically, the configuration may be over-specializing to training minibatches. If both plateau early, capacity or learning rate may be limiting.\n"

    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Apply the already-selected models and preprocessing maps to the reserved holdout split, then report results in a single comparison table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Construct `X_holdout` with the same feature function and the same column basis (`feature_cols`).\n",
    "- Form `y_holdout` and `y_holdout_log` to match the evaluation convention used throughout the notebook.\n",
    "- Standardize `X_holdout` using the training-derived `(mu, sigma)` without refitting.\n",
    "- Produce holdout predictions for Ridge and the MLP, compute metrics via `eval_regression`, and compile them into `summary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "Viewed as function composition, each model evaluates \\(\\hat{y} = h( s( f(r) ) )\\), where \\(f\\) is feature construction, \\(s\\) is standardization, and \\(h\\) is the predictor (Ridge or MLP). This cell holds \\(f\\) and \\(s\\) fixed and compares only \\(h\\), so observed metric differences are attributable to model class rather than preprocessing drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "The neural pathway uses `evaluate_nn_log`, which performs inference under `model.eval()` and `torch.no_grad()`. This disables dropout and gradient tracking, aligning the measured behavior with deployment-time prediction semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "Two metric blocks print (one per model), followed by a `summary` DataFrame. Read the table horizontally: each row is a model, and each column is a metric in either log space or seconds.\n"
