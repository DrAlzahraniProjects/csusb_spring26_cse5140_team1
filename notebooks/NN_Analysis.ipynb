    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1 — Does the NN outperform the tuned Ridge baseline?** Yes. On the 50% holdout set the neural network achieves a substantially higher R2_log (~0.67 vs ~0.38) and roughly halves MAPE (~36% vs ~74%), confirming that a properly tuned NN captures non-linear patterns in trip duration that a linear model cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1 — How well can a neural network predict trip duration from tabular features?**\n",
    "The best NN (selected via 20 validation-only trials with early stopping) reaches an R2_log of ~0.67 and MAPE of ~36% on the holdout set. While original-scale R2 is negative for both models (due to the heavy-tailed distribution of trip duration), the log-space metrics and MAPE demonstrate meaningful predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2 — Which features contribute most?**\n",
    "Permutation importance (5 repeats, validation set) identifies `haversine_km` as the single most important predictor for both models. The NN additionally extracts signal from `delta_lat`, `delta_lon`, `vendor_id`, and cyclical hour encodings, while `store_and_fwd_flag` and `passenger_count` contribute negligibly.\n"
