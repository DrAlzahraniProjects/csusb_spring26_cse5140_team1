    "## 🧾 Cell 12 — 📈 Trial-level performance scan: validation R² across configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Summarize the tuning experiment by visualizing how validation performance varies across trial instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Load `phase2_validation_results.csv` and order trials by `trial_id`.\n",
    "- Plot trial index against `val_r2` to reveal dispersion, trends, or outliers.\n",
    "- Label axes and add a grid for readable comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "This plot is a visual proxy for sensitivity analysis: each point is an estimate of validation R² under a sampled hyperparameter configuration. Wide variance suggests that architecture/optimizer choices materially affect fit quality rather than producing marginal differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "Because each trial corresponds to a distinct MLP configuration, the curve indirectly reflects which hyperparameter regions are stable. It also flags whether performance improvements are sporadic (high variance) or systematic (consistent uplift).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "A line plot with markers appears. Look for abrupt jumps or isolated peaks, which indicate that only a few configurations achieved strong validation performance.\n"

    "## 🧾 Cell 13 — 🧪 Learning dynamics: training loss vs validation RMSE_log for top trials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Inspect how the strongest configurations *arrived* at their performance by comparing within-epoch optimization behavior to validation error trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Reload the tuning results and select the top 3 trials by `val_r2`.\n",
    "- For each selected trial, load its per-epoch `history_csv`.\n",
    "- Plot `train_loss` (SmoothL1) and `val_rmse_log` (dashed) across epochs on the same axes.\n",
    "- Use legends to keep trial identities distinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "Two distinct functionals are plotted: the training objective (SmoothL1 on log residuals) and the validation metric (RMSE in log space). Their joint evolution indicates whether optimization is continuing to reduce training loss while validation error stabilizes or reverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "This diagnostic is particularly informative for dropout/weight-decay regimes: strong regularization often yields slower training loss reduction but smoother validation curves, whereas unstable learning rates manifest as oscillatory validation RMSE_log.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "Expect multiple curves: for each trial, a solid line for training loss and a dashed line for validation RMSE_log. Early-stopped trials will have shorter traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Quality checks\n",
    "If `val_rmse_log` increases while `train_loss` decreases monotonically, the configuration may be over-specializing to training minibatches. If both plateau early, capacity or learning rate may be limiting.\n"

    "## 🧾 Why Log R² Is Our Primary Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 The Problem: Skewed Trip Durations\n",
    "\n",
    "NYC taxi trip durations are **heavily right-skewed** — the vast majority of trips are short (5–15 minutes), but a long tail of trips extends to several hours. This skew causes problems for standard regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE and R² on raw durations** are dominated by a small number of extreme outliers.\n",
    "- A model can appear to perform poorly (even negative R²) simply because a few very long trips produce enormous squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 The Solution: Log Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying `log1p(trip_duration)` we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compress the long tail** — extreme values are pulled closer to the mean.\n",
    "2. **Stabilize variance** — prediction errors become more uniform across short and long trips.\n",
    "3. **Align with proportional accuracy** — a 2-minute error on a 10-minute trip matters more than a 2-minute error on a 2-hour trip. Log space naturally captures this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What This Means for Our Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Space | Role in Our Evaluation |\n",
    "|--------|-------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **R²_log** | Log-transformed | **Primary metric** — fair comparison across all trip lengths |\n",
    "| **RMSE_log** | Log-transformed | Complementary — measures average log-space error |\n",
    "| **R²** | Original (seconds) | Reported for transparency — may be negative due to skew |\n",
    "| **RMSE** | Original (seconds) | Reported for transparency — sensitive to outliers |\n",
    "| **MAPE** | Original (seconds) | Interpretable percentage error |\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why Original-Scale R² Can Be Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative R² on original-scale durations does **not** mean the model is useless. It means the model's squared errors (in seconds) exceed the variance of the raw target — which is inflated by extreme outliers. The log-space R² and MAPE provide a much more reliable picture of predictive quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We report **all metrics** for full transparency, but use **R²_log as the primary comparison metric** because it:\n",
    "- Is robust to the heavy-tailed distribution\n",
    "- Fairly evaluates both short and long trips\n",
    "- Aligns with standard practice for skewed regression targets"

    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Apply the already-selected models and preprocessing maps to the reserved **test** split (stored in `holdout_df`), then report results in a single comparison table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Construct `X_holdout` with the same feature function and the same column basis (`feature_cols`).\n",
    "- Form `y_holdout` and `y_holdout_log` to match the evaluation convention used throughout the notebook.\n",
    "- Standardize `X_holdout` using the training-derived `(mu, sigma)` without refitting.\n",
    "- Produce **test-set** predictions for Ridge and the MLP, compute metrics via `eval_regression`, and compile them into `summary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "Viewed as function composition, each model evaluates \\(\\hat{y} = h( s( f(r) ) )\\), where \\(f\\) is feature construction, \\(s\\) is standardization, and \\(h\\) is the predictor (Ridge or MLP). This cell holds \\(f\\) and \\(s\\) fixed and compares only \\(h\\), so observed metric differences are attributable to model class rather than preprocessing drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "The neural pathway uses `evaluate_nn_log`, which performs inference under `model.eval()` and `torch.no_grad()`. This disables dropout and gradient tracking, aligning the measured behavior with deployment-time prediction semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "Two metric blocks print (one per model), followed by a `summary` DataFrame. Read the table horizontally: each row is a model, and each column is a metric in either log space or seconds.\n"
