    "## 🧾 Why Log R² Is Our Primary Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 The Problem: Skewed Trip Durations\n",
    "\n",
    "NYC taxi trip durations are **heavily right-skewed** — the vast majority of trips are short (5–15 minutes), but a long tail of trips extends to several hours. This skew causes problems for standard regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE and R² on raw durations** are dominated by a small number of extreme outliers.\n",
    "- A model can appear to perform poorly (even negative R²) simply because a few very long trips produce enormous squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 The Solution: Log Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying `log1p(trip_duration)` we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compress the long tail** — extreme values are pulled closer to the mean.\n",
    "2. **Stabilize variance** — prediction errors become more uniform across short and long trips.\n",
    "3. **Align with proportional accuracy** — a 2-minute error on a 10-minute trip matters more than a 2-minute error on a 2-hour trip. Log space naturally captures this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What This Means for Our Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Space | Role in Our Evaluation |\n",
    "|--------|-------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **R²_log** | Log-transformed | **Primary metric** — fair comparison across all trip lengths |\n",
    "| **RMSE_log** | Log-transformed | Complementary — measures average log-space error |\n",
    "| **R²** | Original (seconds) | Reported for transparency — may be negative due to skew |\n",
    "| **RMSE** | Original (seconds) | Reported for transparency — sensitive to outliers |\n",
    "| **MAPE** | Original (seconds) | Interpretable percentage error |\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why Original-Scale R² Can Be Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative R² on original-scale durations does **not** mean the model is useless. It means the model's squared errors (in seconds) exceed the variance of the raw target — which is inflated by extreme outliers. The log-space R² and MAPE provide a much more reliable picture of predictive quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We report **all metrics** for full transparency, but use **R²_log as the primary comparison metric** because it:\n",
    "- Is robust to the heavy-tailed distribution\n",
    "- Fairly evaluates both short and long trips\n",
    "- Aligns with standard practice for skewed regression targets"

    "\n",
    "Even with strict reproducibility and a fair 70/15/15 split, several limitations remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heavy-tailed target distribution:** Trip duration contains extreme outliers (e.g., traffic, detours, errors). These can dominate original-scale squared-error metrics and can make original-scale **R²** appear negative even when predictions are useful in typical cases.\n",
    "- **Clipping in log-space:** We clip predictions to [`CLIP_MIN`, `CLIP_MAX`] to avoid absurd values. This is practical for stability, but it also means very rare long trips are effectively “capped” by design.\n",
    "- **Limited feature set:** We only use a small set of engineered temporal/spatial/context features from `train.csv`. Without external context (weather, events, road networks), there is an upper bound on achievable accuracy.\n",
    "- **Correlated features and importance uncertainty:** Permutation importance can understate the importance of correlated features because “shared signal” can be redistributed across multiple columns (especially in the vendor + time + geometry space).\n",
    "- **Finite tuning budget:** The NN search is constrained to a fixed number of trials and a small safe search space; a better configuration may exist but was not explored under the Phase 1 compute budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Phase 2 can address these\n",
    "- **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)** can perform a more systematic architecture/hyperparameter search under a fixed budget and report optimization cost explicitly.\n",
    "- **Fuzzy Systems (FS)** can provide a more interpretable model (limited feature set + explicit rules), making trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability clearer.\n"

    "\n",
    "By evaluating in **log space** using `log1p(trip_duration)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We **compress the long tail**, so the model is judged on overall behavior rather than a few extreme outliers.\n",
    "- Errors are treated more **proportionally** (a 2-minute miss on a 10-minute trip matters more than a 2-minute miss on a 2-hour trip).\n",
    "- The resulting **R²_log is more stable and more interpretable** for this skewed regression target.\n",
    "\n",
    "For transparency (and to support later cross-dataset comparison rules), we still report original-scale metrics and **MAPE**, but **R²_log** is the most faithful “primary” indicator of general predictive performance for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Interpretation: what the model learned (feature importance)\n",

    "Permutation importance on the **validation set** shows that spatial geometry dominates:\n",

    "A carefully tuned MLP on engineered tabular features produces a **measurable and (via bootstrap) test-validated** improvement over a tuned linear baseline, while log-space evaluation provides a fair and stable view of performance under heavy-tailed trip durations. Phase 2 will expand the comparison by adding **EA optimization cost** and a more **interpretable fuzzy-system alternative**, enabling a principled trade-off analysis across accuracy, compute, and interpretability.\n",
