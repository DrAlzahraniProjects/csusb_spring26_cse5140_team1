    "## 🧾 Cell 12 — 📈 Trial-level performance scan: validation R² across configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Summarize the tuning experiment by visualizing how validation performance varies across trial instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Load `phase2_validation_results.csv` and order trials by `trial_id`.\n",
    "- Plot trial index against `val_r2` to reveal dispersion, trends, or outliers.\n",
    "- Label axes and add a grid for readable comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "This plot is a visual proxy for sensitivity analysis: each point is an estimate of validation R² under a sampled hyperparameter configuration. Wide variance suggests that architecture/optimizer choices materially affect fit quality rather than producing marginal differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "Because each trial corresponds to a distinct MLP configuration, the curve indirectly reflects which hyperparameter regions are stable. It also flags whether performance improvements are sporadic (high variance) or systematic (consistent uplift).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "A line plot with markers appears. Look for abrupt jumps or isolated peaks, which indicate that only a few configurations achieved strong validation performance.\n"

    "## 🧾 Cell 13 — 🧪 Learning dynamics: training loss vs validation RMSE_log for top trials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Research aim\n",
    "Inspect how the strongest configurations *arrived* at their performance by comparing within-epoch optimization behavior to validation error trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Computational steps\n",
    "- Reload the tuning results and select the top 3 trials by `val_r2`.\n",
    "- For each selected trial, load its per-epoch `history_csv`.\n",
    "- Plot `train_loss` (SmoothL1) and `val_rmse_log` (dashed) across epochs on the same axes.\n",
    "- Use legends to keep trial identities distinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Mathematical lens\n",
    "Two distinct functionals are plotted: the training objective (SmoothL1 on log residuals) and the validation metric (RMSE in log space). Their joint evolution indicates whether optimization is continuing to reduce training loss while validation error stabilizes or reverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Neural-network connection\n",
    "This diagnostic is particularly informative for dropout/weight-decay regimes: strong regularization often yields slower training loss reduction but smoother validation curves, whereas unstable learning rates manifest as oscillatory validation RMSE_log.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 How to read the outputs\n",
    "Expect multiple curves: for each trial, a solid line for training loss and a dashed line for validation RMSE_log. Early-stopped trials will have shorter traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Quality checks\n",
    "If `val_rmse_log` increases while `train_loss` decreases monotonically, the configuration may be over-specializing to training minibatches. If both plateau early, capacity or learning rate may be limiting.\n"

    "## 🧾 Why Log R² Is Our Primary Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 The Problem: Skewed Trip Durations\n",
    "\n",
    "NYC taxi trip durations are **heavily right-skewed** — the vast majority of trips are short (5–15 minutes), but a long tail of trips extends to several hours. This skew causes problems for standard regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE and R² on raw durations** are dominated by a small number of extreme outliers.\n",
    "- A model can appear to perform poorly (even negative R²) simply because a few very long trips produce enormous squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 The Solution: Log Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying `log1p(trip_duration)` we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compress the long tail** — extreme values are pulled closer to the mean.\n",
    "2. **Stabilize variance** — prediction errors become more uniform across short and long trips.\n",
    "3. **Align with proportional accuracy** — a 2-minute error on a 10-minute trip matters more than a 2-minute error on a 2-hour trip. Log space naturally captures this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 What This Means for Our Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Space | Role in Our Evaluation |\n",
    "|--------|-------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **R²_log** | Log-transformed | **Primary metric** — fair comparison across all trip lengths |\n",
    "| **RMSE_log** | Log-transformed | Complementary — measures average log-space error |\n",
    "| **R²** | Original (seconds) | Reported for transparency — may be negative due to skew |\n",
    "| **RMSE** | Original (seconds) | Reported for transparency — sensitive to outliers |\n",
    "| **MAPE** | Original (seconds) | Interpretable percentage error |\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why Original-Scale R² Can Be Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative R² on original-scale durations does **not** mean the model is useless. It means the model's squared errors (in seconds) exceed the variance of the raw target — which is inflated by extreme outliers. The log-space R² and MAPE provide a much more reliable picture of predictive quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We report **all metrics** for full transparency, but use **R²_log as the primary comparison metric** because it:\n",
    "- Is robust to the heavy-tailed distribution\n",
    "- Fairly evaluates both short and long trips\n",
    "- Aligns with standard practice for skewed regression targets"

    "## 🧾 Limitations (Phase 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with strict reproducibility and a fair 70/15/15 split, several limitations remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heavy-tailed target distribution:** Trip duration contains extreme outliers (e.g., traffic, detours, errors). These can dominate original-scale squared-error metrics and can make original-scale **R²** appear negative even when predictions are useful in typical cases.\n",
    "- **Clipping in log-space:** We clip predictions to [`CLIP_MIN`, `CLIP_MAX`] to avoid absurd values. This is practical for stability, but it also means very rare long trips are effectively “capped” by design.\n",
    "- **Limited feature set:** We only use a small set of engineered temporal/spatial/context features from `train.csv`. Without external context (weather, events, road networks), there is an upper bound on achievable accuracy.\n",
    "- **Correlated features and importance uncertainty:** Permutation importance can understate the importance of correlated features because “shared signal” can be redistributed across multiple columns (especially in the vendor + time + geometry space).\n",
    "- **Finite tuning budget:** The NN search is constrained to a fixed number of trials and a small safe search space; a better configuration may exist but was not explored under the Phase 1 compute budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Phase 2 can address these\n",
    "- **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)** can perform a more systematic architecture/hyperparameter search under a fixed budget and report optimization cost explicitly.\n",
    "- **Fuzzy Systems (FS)** can provide a more interpretable model (limited feature set + explicit rules), making trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability clearer.\n"

       "- Errors are treated more **proportionally** (a 2-minute miss on a 10-minute trip matters more than a 2-minute miss on a 2-hour trip).\n",
       "- The resulting **R²_log is more stable and more interpretable** for this skewed regression target.\n",
       "\n",
       "For transparency (and to support later cross-dataset comparison rules), we still report original-scale metrics and **MAPE**, but **R²_log** is the most faithful “primary” indicator of general predictive performance for this dataset.\n",

    "NYC trip duration is **heavy-tailed and right-skewed**: most rides are short, but a small fraction are extremely long due to traffic, detours, incidents, or recording noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- On the **original scale (seconds)**, squared-error-based metrics (like RMSE and R²) can be dominated by a few extreme trips.  \n",
    "- That dominance can make **original-scale R² negative**, even when the model is meaningfully accurate on the vast majority of typical trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating in **log space** using `log1p(trip_duration)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We **compress the long tail**, so the model is judged on overall behavior rather than a few extreme outliers.\n",
    "- Errors are treated more **proportionally** (a 2-minute miss on a 10-minute trip matters more than a 2-minute miss on a 2-hour trip).\n",
    "- The resulting **R²_log is more stable and more interpretable** for this skewed regression target.\n",
    "\n",
    "For transparency (and to support later cross-dataset comparison rules), we still report original-scale metrics and **MAPE**, but **R²_log** is the most faithful “primary” indicator of general predictive performance for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Interpretation: what the model learned (feature importance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation importance on the **validation set** shows that spatial geometry dominates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top driver (both models):** `haversine_km`  \n",
    "- The NN also benefits from temporal encodings (hour/day cycles) and contextual proxies (e.g., vendor), suggesting it captures **nonlinear interactions** beyond a linear ridge model.\n",
    "- In the grouped view, the NN’s strongest feature group is: **{top_group_line}**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Reproducibility + compute cost artifacts (submission readiness)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compute budget used:** {TRIALS} NN trials, total tuning time ≈ **{total_time/60:.2f} minutes** on **{device}**.\n",
    "- **Environment snapshot written:** `../environment_summary.md` and `../pip_freeze.txt`.\n",
    "- **Model saved and reloadable:** `../artifacts/best_mlp_model.pt` + reload demo cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Final takeaway (Phase 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "A carefully tuned MLP on engineered tabular features produces a **measurable and (via bootstrap) test-validated** improvement over a tuned linear baseline, while log-space evaluation provides a fair and stable view of performance under heavy-tailed trip durations. Phase 2 will expand the comparison by adding **EA optimization cost** and a more **interpretable fuzzy-system alternative**, enabling a principled trade-off analysis across accuracy, compute, and interpretability.\n",
